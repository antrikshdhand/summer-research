## Optimising UAR Sampling

My project focused on optimising Uniform At Random (UAR) sampling for grammar inference. It involved:
- Development of efficient data structures for grammar representation.
- Creation of a JSON-to-C converter for seamless integration with existing formats.
- Implementation of sampling algorithms in the C programming language to leverage efficiency.
- Significant performance improvements achieved compared to existing Python implementations.
- Demonstrated up to 23 times faster execution for basic fuzzing and 14 times faster for UAR sampling.
- Contribution to the field through the provision of open-source tools and transparent documentation.
