/*
Given a context-free grammar (CFG) defined in Backus-Naur Form (BNF), such as:

G = {
    <start>     :   <digits>
    <digits>    :   <digit> <digits> 
                    | <digit>
    <digit>     :   "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
},

which produces integers of variable length, we want to convert it into some
representation in C which can later be used for sampling.

We will use structs to represent our grammar, which is composed of
non-terminals and rules/productions:

- Our `Grammar` is made up of `NonTerminal`s.
- A `NonTerminal` struct captures the following form: A -> ùõô. The LHS is the
    non-terminal itself, represented using angle brackets, and the RHS is the
    list of productions or rules of that non-terminal (we use `Rule` here for
    conciseness).
- A `Rule` is simply a string of characters which a non-terminal can produce.
